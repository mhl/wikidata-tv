<h1>About this site</h1>

<p>
I hacked together this site because with TV series I know really
well (for example:
<a href="{{ url_for('random_episode', wikidata_item='Q189350') }}">30 Rock</a> and
<a href="{{ url_for('random_episode', wikidata_item='Q16290') }}">Star Trek: TNG</a>)
it's easy to just watch your favourite episodes over and
over. It's sometimes nice, instead, to watch a randomly chosen episode,
so you don't get bored and can rediscover some gems. Also, I've
been involved
with <a href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Grants:Project/mySociety/EveryPolitician">a
Wikidata project at work</a>, and I'm generally excited about
its potential :)
</p>

<p>
  The <a href="https://github.com/mhl/wikidata-tv">(pretty
  sloppy) code is on GitHub</a> and you can get in contact with
  me by email at: <img src="http://sphinx.mythic-beasts.com/~mark/random/email.png"></a>
